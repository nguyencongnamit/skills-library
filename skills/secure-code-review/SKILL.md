# Secure Code Review

## Rules (for AI agents)

### ALWAYS
- Use parameterized queries / prepared statements for all database access. Never build
  SQL by string concatenation, even for "trusted" inputs.
- Validate input at the trust boundary — type, length, allowed characters, allowed
  range — and reject before processing.
- Encode output for the rendering context (HTML escape for HTML, URL encode for query
  params, JSON encode for JSON output).
- Use the language's built-in cryptography library, never custom-rolled crypto. Prefer
  AES-GCM for symmetric encryption, Ed25519 / RSA-PSS for signatures, Argon2id /
  bcrypt for password hashing.
- Use `crypto/rand` (Go), `secrets` module (Python), `crypto.randomBytes` (Node.js), or
  the platform CSPRNG for any random value involved in security (tokens, IDs,
  session keys).
- Set explicit security headers on HTTP responses: `Content-Security-Policy`,
  `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`.
- Use the principle of least privilege for file paths, database users, IAM policies,
  and process privileges.

### NEVER
- Build SQL/NoSQL queries by string concatenation with user input.
- Pass user input directly to `exec`, `system`, `eval`, `Function()`, `child_process`,
  `subprocess.run(shell=True)`, or any other command-execution path.
- Trust client-side validation. Always re-validate server-side.
- Use `MD5` or `SHA1` for any new security-sensitive purpose (passwords, signatures,
  HMAC). Use SHA-256 / SHA-3 / BLAKE2 / Argon2id instead.
- Use ECB mode for any encryption, ever. Prefer GCM, CCM, or ChaCha20-Poly1305.
- Use `==` for password comparison — use a constant-time comparison
  (`hmac.compare_digest`, `crypto.timingSafeEqual`, `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`).
- Allow user input to determine file paths without canonicalization and allowlist
  checks (defends against `../../../etc/passwd` style path traversal).
- Disable TLS certificate verification in production code — `verify=False`,
  `InsecureSkipVerify: true`, `rejectUnauthorized: false`.

### KNOWN FALSE POSITIVES
- Internal admin tools intentionally executing shell commands against trusted, fixed
  arguments are acceptable when documented and code-reviewed.
- Cryptographic test vectors using `MD5` / `SHA1` for compatibility with documented
  protocols (e.g. legacy interop tests) are acceptable.
- Constant-time comparison is overkill for non-secret comparisons (string equality in
  logs, tag matching).

## Context (for humans)

Most modern web vulnerabilities boil down to the same handful of root causes: failure
to validate input, failure to use the right cryptographic primitive, failure to apply
least privilege, failure to use the framework's built-in defenses. This skill is the
AI's checklist for not falling into those traps.
